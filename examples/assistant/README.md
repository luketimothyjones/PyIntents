voice_intents.py is a demonstration of how pyretree can be used to create a speech recognition system

voice.py uses Google's cloud speech recognition; use 'run.bat' to run it (you will need a voice Google API oauth file titled voice.json in the same directory)

winvoice.py uses Windows' speech recognition (see resources/MSSpeechInstallers/ for the installer and voices). It is currently not functioning for unknown reasons.
